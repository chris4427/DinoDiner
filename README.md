# 🦕 DinoDiner

DinoDiner is a point-of-sale (POS) system and menu showcase website developed as part of the **CIS 400: Object-Oriented Design, Implementation, and Testing** course at **Kansas State University**. 
This semester-long project demonstrates principles of object-oriented programming, test-driven development, and UI design using XAML and Razor Pages. It is the first long-term project that I worked on while
learning Computer Science.
